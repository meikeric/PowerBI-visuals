/// NOTE about BeachParty panels:
///     - This is a description of how to build our (very regular and simple) panels.  This is not a general panel building system;
///       it will only work for our specific style of panels.
///     - Being a JSON description, we can make panel easier to write, read, and maintain.  We also add our own very
///       specific kind of data binding.
///     - The hope is by keeping things simple and limited, we can make this easy to build.
